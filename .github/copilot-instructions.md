# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
- First general instruction
- Second general instruction

## Code Style
- If statements are block statements. Never use if statements without block quotes (curly braces). Not ever anywhere in my code. Not in any projects. It is slobby, ugly, and prone to bugs. 
- If block content is 1 line with less than 50 non-space characters, the block can be on the same line with the if().
